    <h1 class="titel">RULE ONE, YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT ATS.</h1>
    <div class="Reason">
        <h3>What's ATS?</h3>
        <h5>ATS is a communication service just like discord, excluding all the moderation and <br> privacy evation and alleged p2p chat. <br><br> ATS Dont care who you are, where you live, your thoughts, your background. <br> He defenatly hates KYC! </h5>
        <h3 class="Second">How is ATS safe?</h3>
        <h5>I dont know how safe ATS is, but I know its open source, and that ATS hate KYC. ATS will only be available for download <br> 
        at an .Onion link, ATS hate your IP. Also, when you sign up, you will get a privatekey and a publickey. <br><br>
    Private key <br> You <span class="RED">SHOULDN'T</span> share your private key. The private key works like your password and username combined. You use it to log in! <br><br> 
    Public key <br> You <span class="Green">SHOULD</span> share your public key. The public key works like your invite letter, only one ATS user can use your public key. <br> 
    When someone uses your public key, a request will get sent to you, you can either accept or decline. theirs request. <br>
    No matter if you accept or decline, your past publickey will be destroyed and a new one will be generated, thus to help you disapear. <br><br>
    We plan to not store any logs! you the user store all the chatlogs on your own system. ATS only store the Public and Private keys, to pair you with others and I am too tired to write more now!
    </h5>
        <h3>Todo!</h3>
        <h5>1. Improve the responsivenes on the site with different screen size. <br> 2. Improve the typography! Make it so simple a kid can understand it! <br>
