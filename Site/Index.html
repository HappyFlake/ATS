    <h1 class="titel">RULE ONE, YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT ATS.</h1>
    <div class="Reason">
        <h3>What is ATS?</h3>
        <h5>ATS is a communication service like Discord, but without the moderation, privacy invasions, or questionable peer-to-peer chat setups.
            ATS doesn’t care who you are, where you're from, what you think. ATS hate KYC (Know Your Customer), no identity checks, ever. </h5>
        <h3 class="Second">Is ATS Safe?</h3>
        <h5>How safe is ATS? That’s up to you to decide, but here’s what ATS know: <br>
            [1] ATS is open-source. <br>
            [2] It’s only available through a .onion (Tor) address, ATS doesn’t want your IP. <br>
            [3] When you sign up, you're given a private key and a public key. <br><br>
            <span class="RED">Your Private Key</span> <br> Your private key is like your username and password combined. It’s how you log in, KEEP IT A SECRET! <br><br>
            <span class="Green">Your Public Key</span> <br>Your public Key is your "Handle". One ATS user can use your public key to send you a connection request. <br>
            Once someone uses it, you get to accept or decline the request. No matter what you choose, that public key will selfdestruct and a new public key is created
            helping you stay anonymous and untraceable. YOU CAN SHARE THIS TO OTHERS!
        </h5>
    <h3 class="Second">What Does ATS Store?</h3>
    <h5>Almost nothing. You store your own chat logs on your device.
        ATS only uses keys to help connect users. No logs, no surveillance. <br><br> P.S. I’m too tired to write more, but the goal is simple: private, no-KYC, peer-to-peer communication with 100% control to the user.</h5>
        <h3>Todo!</h3>
        <h5>1. Improve the responsivenes on the site with different screen size. <br> 2. Improve the typography! Make it so simple a kid can understand it! <br>
            3. Improve the HTML and CSS code! // Add more comments and organize the code! <br> 4. Make everything undragable and prevent inspectelement from normies! </h5>
